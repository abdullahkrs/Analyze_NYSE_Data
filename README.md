# Analyze_NYSE_Data
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange by using a subset of a larger dataset provided by Kaggle, consisting of historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. The smaller subset will be analyzed to gain insights into the trends and patterns of the stock market, and to identify potential investment opportunities. The project will provide students with hands-on experience in data analysis and will enhance their skills in handling large datasets, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Why this Project?
This project teaches the data analysis process which will be used in the Nanodegree program. This includes calculating summary statistics, making inferences from the data, measuring business metrics, and using various data tools. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of how to approach and analyze data effectively.

## Background:
Our analysis used Kaggle's Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files, which include financial data for 448 S&P 500 companies gathered from SEC 10K filings and industry/sector classifications, respectively. These files were utilized to conduct further analysis and generate insights.

## The following information is included in the Project data NYSE file:
- Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
- Years: Number of years for which data is provided
- Period ending
- Total revenue
- Cost of goods sold
- Sales, General and Administrative expenses
- Research and Development expenses
- Other Operating expense items
- Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: Industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
- GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of Airlines industry.)

## Project Goals:
Here are the three tasks.

Task 1:
a. Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis, and include this in your slide presentation.

- Your question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
- A tab within the Excel spreadsheet that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] you used to answer your question.
- Deliverable: Slide presentation, Spreadsheet with tab for Summary statistics

b. Your slide presentation should provide at least one visualization to help with your answer.

- This visualization might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot or other visual that you learned to make. Include your insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.
- Deliverable: Slide presentation (includes visualization)


Task 2:
- Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
- Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
- The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
- Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement


Task 3:
- Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
- Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
- The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.
- Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Forecasting Model
