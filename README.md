## Project Overview - Analyzing NYSE Data

# Introduction:
The objective of this project is to analyze a subset of the larger Kaggle dataset, which contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By delving into this data, we aim to gain valuable insights into stock market trends and patterns, while also identifying potential investment opportunities. This hands-on experience will enhance students' data analysis skills, including data handling, visualization, and statistical analysis.

# Project Background:
We utilized Kaggle's Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files for our analysis, which offer financial data for 448 S&P 500 companies sourced from SEC 10K filings. Additionally, the Securities.csv file provides industry and sector classifications based on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). These datasets serve as the foundation for further analysis and insight generation.

# Project Goals:
The project is designed around three main tasks:

## Task 1:
a. Formulate a data-driven question that incorporates at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (financial metric). The question should necessitate the use of summary statistics, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation, range).

Deliverables:
Slide presentation with the formulated question and insights derived from summary statistics.
Spreadsheet with a dedicated tab containing the summary statistics used in the analysis.

b. Utilize at least one data visualization (e.g., bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box plot) to aid in addressing the question. Provide insights from measures of center and spread, along with at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.

Deliverable:
Slide presentation featuring the visualization and its corresponding insights.

## Task 2:
Create an interactive dashboard for a Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement that computes the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a selected company from a drop-down list. The dashboard should display historical data for the chosen company.

Deliverable:

Spreadsheet with a dynamic P&L statement tab, presenting Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all available years.

## Task 3:
Develop a financial model for a different company (from Task 2) that forecasts Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for the next two years. The model should incorporate three scenarios: Best case, Weak case, and Base case, each with distinct assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin.

Deliverable:
Spreadsheet with a forecasting model tab, allowing the selection of scenarios and displaying projected financials for the chosen company.

# Conclusion:
By analyzing real-life NYSE data, this project equips students with essential data analysis skills and a comprehensive understanding of effective data handling, visualization, and statistical techniques. The insights gained from this project will contribute to students' practical knowledge and enhance their ability to work with large datasets.
